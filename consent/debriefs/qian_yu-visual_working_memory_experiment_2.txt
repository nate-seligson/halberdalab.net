Qian Yu - Visual Working Memory Experiment 2
------
Is working memory simply the reactivation of perceptual 
representations?  Decoding experiments with fMRI suggest that 
perceptual areas maintain information about what we have seen in 
working memory.  But is this activity the basis of visual working 
memory itself?  If it is, then perceptual interference during maintenance 
should impair our ability to remember.  

We want to this prediction by measuring visual working memory 
performance with and without interfering mask gratings, presented 
during the memory delay at the same location as the to-be-
remembered stimulus.  But the first step is to test whether the mask 
gratings are indeed interfering, that is, can interfere with visual 
perception.

We reasoned that if visual working memory relies on early perceptual 
substrates then exposure to conflicting masks that putatively activate 
the same substrates should impair performance (relative to no-mask 
trials).  In other words, there should be interference, between the 
rapidly changing perceptual inputs and the perceptually maintained 
memory representations at the same retinal location. 

In this experiment, we predict that the mask condition and unmasked 
condition do not differ in terms of task performance (accuracy). If we 
do not see an effect of masks, it would support our hypothesis that our 
visual working memory does not rely on perceptual reuse.
