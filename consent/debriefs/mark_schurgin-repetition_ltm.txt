Mark Schurgin - Repetition LTM
------
Thank you for your participation in this experiment. This study 
investigates object perception and memory. Specifically, we are 
interested in how the way you re-encounter objects affects your 
subsequent memory of those objects. During the study you saw the 
same objects but sometimes repeated, and this may actually change the 
way you represent that object when you're then tested on it. If you have 
any questions about this experiment, or wish to further discuss the 
cognitive science underlying this experiment, please contact Mark 
Schurgin at maschurgin@jhu.edu.
