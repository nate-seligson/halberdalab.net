How can we perceive a global pattern? It is an important question 
because each neuron in our retina, as well as in our early visual cortex, 
can only respond to a restricted region in the whole visual field. When 
we only have local regional information, we may lose the big picture. 
For example, in the story of blind men and an elephant, each blind man 
can only perceive a restricted part of the elephant, and they as a group 
can hardly form a correct concept of the elephant. Our visual system, in 
contrast, can always figure out the global pattern even though neurons 
in early processing can only see a part. How can our visual system 
achieve this? What rules are involved in such computation? The first 
goal of this study is to understand the integration of local information to 
form a global perception.
This study is also related to the representation format of the human 
location perception. A different way of representing location information 
may have different results in difficulties of perceiving a global pattern. In 
what rule do we integrate dots into a pattern? What dot patterns are 
easier to perceive, and why they are easier for us to detect? We use 
Glass Patterns, a self-correlated random dot set, to construct different 
global patterns. We aim to test on how well can participants perceive 
different dot patterns in the presence of noise.
