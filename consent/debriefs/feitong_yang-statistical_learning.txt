Feitong Yang - Statistical Learning
------
Research has shown that people can implicitly extract the statistical 
structures and statistical information in the outside world while not aware 
of them. The current project is to investigate how fast the learning happens 
and how is the response pattern changing over the process of statistical 
learning. Participants take an RSVP test repeatedly to indicate whether 
they actually learned the structures. If you have any questions, please 
contact us via email above. Thank you very much for participating in this 
experiment.

Time: 40-45 min
