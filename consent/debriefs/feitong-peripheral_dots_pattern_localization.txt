Feitong - Peripheral Dots Pattern Localization
------
How do we perceive shapes? Do we need to have a continuous contour of 
the shape or not? In this study, we test whether people can recognize 
different shapes that are purely made by dots. There is no continuous 
contour of any shape, yet people seem to be able to understand many of 
them. The second question we ask is what shapes are easier to recognize 
than others and why. People search for a unique target shape among 
several shapes and we want to see which shapes are easier to perceive.
