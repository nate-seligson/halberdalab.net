Qian Yu - Ensemble
------
Natural scenes are dense with information, however, this clutter is not 
completely random. Instead, natural scenes are filled with similar or 
redundant groups of objects, features, and textures. The visual system 
is sensitive to these similarities in both natural (e.g., stand of trees, 
crowd of faces) and artificial (e.g., car lot, bike rack) groups in the form 
of ensemble or summary statistical information. We can extract 
summary statistics along many dimensions, including the average hue 
of the tree leaves, average facial expression of the bystanders, and 
average speed of the cyclists.

The way we perceive ensembles seems to be similar to how we 
perceive a single object. In this series of experiments, we aim to 
investigate whether we process ensembles as if they were single 
objects.
