Shanmukha Aditya Upadhyayula - Debriefing form for visual spatial noise measurement experiment
------
Primary investigator : Jonathan Flombaum. Email : flombaum@jhu.edu. Our visual 
system is constrained by the non-uniform resolution in our retinas. As a result, our 
perception of the world might be noisier in the peripheral vision. This plays a 
crucial role in selectively attending to the stimuli in the real world. In spite of this 
limitation, we are able to select multiple stimuli at the same time. Recent work from 
our lab has suggested that this ability of ours to simultaneously select multiple 
items might be constrained by the visual spatial noise of our retinas. In this 
experiment, we attempt to mathematically formulate this spatial noise. We do this 
by asking you to fixate in the centre of the screen, and make a brightness 
judgement between dot pairs that are presented anywhere in the periphery. Our 
hypothesis is that the accuracy of the judgements should vary as a function of the 
size of the dots, and the distance at which these dots are presented. We then use 
these accuracy values to fit in mathematical models that then describe the spatial 
noise profile for each individual.
