Josh Langfus - Categorical Change Detection
------
How do social categories like race and gender influence visual perception? The capacity limits of visual working memory have been widely studied, and most researchers agree that humans can maintain no more than about four objects simultaneously in memory. There is an ongoing debate, however, over whether working memory capacity depends in some way on the properties of the items being represented; is the limit lower for more complex items (e.g., faces) than for simper items (e.g., colored dots)? 
One interesting possibility is that humans extract category information from complex stimuli and that this helps reduce memory load, improving performance for complex stimuli in tasks designed to measure working memory limits. This theory is supported by work suggesting that people are better at noticing cross-category changes (e.g., detecting that an object changed from being a 3D shaded cube to a kanji character) compared to within-category changes (e.g., a shaded cube compared to a shaded cube at a different orientation).
In this study, we explored this cross-category change detection benefit in the context of social categories. On some trials, the target stimulus changed to an exemplar within the same category (viz. race or gender), and on other trials it changed to an exemplar from a different category. The colored-dot trials were used to measure within-subject baseline performance on this task. We are interested in measuring the extent to which crossing the category boundaries of these social categories improves performance on working memory tasks. If we see such an effect, it would support previous work suggesting that group-identifying information, such as race and gender, is rapidly and automatically inferred from visual scenes. Of particular interest here is that this this information measurably influences a low-level cognitive ability, i.e., visual working memory. This may have implications for the study of implicit bias and in-group / out-group dynamics.
