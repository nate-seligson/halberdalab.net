In this study, we would like to measure how fast you can consolidate 
different categories of item into working memory.

In previous research, Alvarez and Cavanagh demonstrated that working 
memory capacity is limited by the information of the items.  

Here, we want to find out through what way information limits working 
memory capacity, and our hypothesis is that information influence your 
consolidation of the item into working memory, thus affecting working 
memory capacity.
