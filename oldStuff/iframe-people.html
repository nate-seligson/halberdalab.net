                              <p class = "p2">I have interests in visual attention and visual working memory.  Recently, this has led to interests in set-based representations (e.g. number of items, average size, average orientation, centroid).  Such representations collapse across many individuals to represent general tendencies of a group of items. I am also interested in the psychophysics of numerical estimation; the innate ability to approximate the number of items in a set.</p></td>

                              <span class="style5">I have broad research interests in visual perception, attention, and how they interact. I have focussed on how the visual system optimizes the use of its limited resources and what heuristics are involved in efficient coding of the visual scene. Representing general descriptions (such as holistic processing of a gist and statistical properties) instead of every detail of the visual scene is one way to economize on the limited capacity of the visual system. To understand how the visual system represents these general descriptions, I am currently working on the neural mechanisms of the represenation of ensemble features (e.g., the processes of averaging size or orientation and approximating the number of objects) and set-based representation.</span></p>

                         		Despite initial impressions, human cognition is not unified, and, at any given time, different kinds of mental representations concurrently interact and influence our behaviour. My research focuses on how various mental representations develop, how they differ in kind from one another, how they interact to successfully guide our behaviour. I seek to answer these questions through work on both children (through the Lab for Child Development), and adults. Currently, I am exploring how different kinds of number representations interact with one another, with language, and with other cognitive systems. I am specifically interested in the relationships between the Approximate Number System, visual-short term memory, and spatial representations. I hope to use these insights to answer questions about the nature of human thought, its limits, the covergence of varying representations on coherent behaviours, and how all these relate to consciousness and to the impression of unification.

  <p class = "p2">My main interests are in cognitive neuroscience, computer science, and the intersection between the two fields, such as computational neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and computer vision. I have been a part of the Vision and Cognition Lab for several years, programming, running adult subjects on, and analyzing results from various studies on visual processing of ensemble features and the approximate number system. I am currently working on studying the relationship between a person's ability to discriminate between different groups of items and their strength in mathematics, as well as how various properties of a scene and of individuals facilitate the formation of set-based representations.</p>

Computer Science. My background comes in the form of computer programming, and I'm
enthusiastic to have the role of designing experimentation software at the Vision
Cognition Lab. My interests include applying Computer Science (i.e. programming) to
create controlled visual and cognition experiments to study the counting of items in
a given visual set. I'm also interested in studying Neurological systems.
