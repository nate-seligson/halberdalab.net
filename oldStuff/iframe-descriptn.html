<h1>Welcome</h1></p>
<p class="p2">In The Vision &amp; Cognition Lab (<em>directed by Prof. Justin Halberda</em>) we’re interested in the limits of visual attention and visual working memory (VWM) and how these limits are affected by the structure of the information to be stored.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For instance, while the limit of visual working memory has traditionally been discussed as either information- or object-based (e.g. a limit of 3 objects) research in our lab suggests that in some cases VWM can store sets of items rather than single objects (e.g. a limit of 3 sets) (<a href="publications/Halberda_Sires_Feig_2006.pdf">Halberda et at, 2006</a>).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These results extend what counts as an “object” in VWM to include sets of multiple items that share some distinctive property or location and reveals new “ensemble features” which collapse information across multiple objects.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While this work is a major portion of the lab’s current research, we are interested in all aspects of visual attention and visual working memory.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Typical experiments in the lab use visual search, change detection, or rapid parallel enumeration as a method.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Students also have the opportunity to run experiments in our affiliated Laboratory for Child Development where we test infants and children in a variety of tasks relevant to visual attention and working memory. We also have ongoing collaborations with our other affiliated labs including projects with Dr. Jonathan Flombaum and Dr. Steve Yantis.</p>
