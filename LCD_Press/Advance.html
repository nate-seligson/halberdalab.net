												<p>&quot;We
investigate how infants and young children perceive and reason about
the world around them,&quot; explained Lisa Feigenson, PhD, co-director with
Justin Halberda, PhD, of the lab in the Zanvyl Krieger School of Arts
and Sciences at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Johns</st1:placename> <st1:placename w:st="on">Hopkins</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">University</st1:placetype></st1:place>.
&quot;Through our work, we have discovered that in many ways children know
much, much more than people once thought they did; but in other ways
children perceive the world quite differently than adults do.&quot;</p>
<p>Drs. Feigenson and Halberda, pictured above, are assistant professors of psychological and brain sciences. </p>
<p>Topics studied in their lab include how infants and young children
keep track of and reason about moving or hidden objects, how children
learn words for new objects and actions, and how they understand
numbers prior to any formal mathematical education. The studies, which
involve children ages 3 months to 6 years, take place in a brightly
painted lab decorated in a friendly zoo theme.</p>
<p>&quot;We felt it was very important that the lab environment be cheerful
and colorful and be a place where babies, children and their parents
could feel at home and at ease,&quot; Dr. Halberda said. &quot;We’re interested
in how babies and children process information. In order for them to do
that in the most natural way possible, they have to be comfortable.&quot;</p>
<p>Drs. Feigenson and Halberda, who are married, came to Johns Hopkins from <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Harvard</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">University</st1:placetype></st1:place>
last summer to set up and run the new Laboratory for Child Development.
dr. Feigenson specializes in the study of how infants keep track of and
remember objects, while Dr. Halberda studies word learning and logical
reasoning.</p>
<p>Though their research interests diverge, they have the same goal of
understanding how infants and young children perceive and contemplate
the world around them. They do this through a variety of studies
approved by a Johns Hopkins University Institutional Review Board. The
studies take the form of simple games that babies, children and even
parents—all volunteers from the community—usually find fun and
engaging. </p>
<p>&quot;In our infant studies, for instance, a baby sits in an infant seat
and watches a kind of show consisting of objects or video animations,&quot;
Dr. Feigenson explained. &quot;We record the baby’s behavior and measure how
long he or she spends looking at or reaching for an object.&quot;</p>
<p>What can the researchers learn from such a simple exercises?</p>
<p>&quot;Babies usually look longer at things they find new or surprising,
so we can make inferences about how they perceive and understand what
they see by looking for patterns of behavior across a number of
infants,&quot; Dr. Halberda stated. &quot;We are looking at patterns, not
performances of individual children.&quot;</p>
<p>These patterns can inform parents, pediatricians and scientists about what goes on in the mind of a young child. </p>
<p>&quot;In infants and small children,&quot; Dr. Feigenson reported, &quot;we use
behavioral patterns to make inferences about babies’ knowledge—not just
whether they have or don’t have some bit of knowledge, such as whether
they know that things continue to exist even when they can’t see them,
but also how that knowledge is structured. Does one bit of knowledge
depend on another; does it require experience in the world in order for
it to develop; or is it hard-wired into the brain as a product of
evolution? Finally, how can a big blob of brain tissue ever contain the
complexities of information babies and small children deal with every
day? These are just some of the subjects we are interested in
exploring.&quot;</p>
<p>Johns Hopkins paid for the construction of the new lab facility, and
Drs. Feigenson and Halberda are in the process of applying to the
National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation for
funding of their research studies.</p>
