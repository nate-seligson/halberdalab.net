<p><strong>Abstract </strong></p>
<p class="jpbody"><span class="style4 jpbody"><em><span class="style15">Human mathematical competence emerges from two representational  systems. Competence in some domains of mathematics,  such as calculus, relies on symbolic representations that are  unique to humans who have undergone explicit teaching.  More basic numerical intuitions are supported by an evolutionarily  ancient approximate number system that is shared by  adults, infants and non-human animals- these groups can  all represent the approximate number of items in visual or auditory  arrays without verbally counting, and use this capacity to  guide everyday behaviour such as foraging. Despite the widespread  nature of the approximate number system both across species  and across development, it is not known whether some  individuals have a more precise non-verbal &lsquo;number sense&rsquo; than  others. Furthermore, the extent to which this system interfaces  with the formal, symbolic maths abilities that humans acquire  by explicit instruction remains unknown. Here we show that there  are large individual differences in the non-verbal approximation  abilities of 14-year-old children, and that these individual differences  in the present correlate with children&rsquo;s past scores on standardized  maths achievement tests, extending all the way back to  kindergarten. Moreover, this correlation remains significant when  controlling for individual differences in other cognitive and performance  factors. Our results show that individual differences in  achievement in school mathematics are related to individual differences  in the acuity of an evolutionarily ancient, unlearned  approximate number sense. Further research will determine  whether early differences in number sense acuity affect later maths  learning, whether maths education enhances number sense acuity,  and the extent to which tertiary factors can affect both. </span></em></span></p>
<p><strong>Methods </strong></p>
<p><span class="jpbody style15">Sixty-four  14-yr-old children completed this task twice at an interval of  approximately 60 min, as the first and last sub-tasks in a larger test  battery from  the longitudinal study. Each run of the task lasted 5 min. Subjects  viewed dot  arrays on a computer screen and judged whether there were more blue or  more  yellow dots. Click play to view some trials. The correct answer is  given after each trial, though subjects never saw these answers.</span></p>
